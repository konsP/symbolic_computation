Hig and low level implementations of Euler's totient and factorial in Chapel and X10

Two micro-benchmarks in two state-of-the-art languages, representing the Partitioned
Global Address Space (PGAS) programming model, Chapel and X10. W
Small-scale performance study on two algorithms, both representatives of symbolic computation, the
Euler Totient function and the factorial computation. In an effort to evaluate parallel performance we produce both high
and low level implementations of these algorithms and measure the performance on networks of multi-cores.

This is work performed for a paper called "A case sstudy of PGAS Languages for Symbolic C omputation on  Multi-core Clusters" (never really submitted)
